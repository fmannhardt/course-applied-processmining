    "A common industry standard for Process Model is [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/), which can be created by web-based tools like [BPMN.io](https://bpmn.io/) and loaded and used by PM4Py. We load a manually drawn BPMN model that described the expected process behaviour of the `Sepsis Process`. This is a process that describes several logistical and diagnostic activities performed for patients in a hospital that are suspected to have a life-threatening sepsis condition. An event log that was extracted from the information system of a hospital is publicly available and serves as ouor running example."
