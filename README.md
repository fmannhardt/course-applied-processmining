# Applied Process Mining Module

* **Responsible Group**: [Process Analytics group](https://pa.win.tue.nl/) at Eindhoven University of Technology
* **Responsible Lecturer**: Dr. Felix Mannhardt ([@fmannhardt](https://twitter.com/fmannhardt)) 

The notebooks in this repository are part of an Applied Process Mining module. In total there are currently *4* lectures and the associated hands-on notebooks in this repository. The collection of notebooks is a *living document* and subject to change. Each lecture is accompanied by a notebook in both R and Python using the Process Mining frameworks bupaR and PM4Py, respectively.

## Installation \& Usage

### Using MyBinder

Simply click on the `launch binder` links for either the R or the Python notebook. You may also use the Google Colab service by clicking on the Google Colab links, however, you may need to prepare the Google Colab environment to have the respective packages installed.

### Run locally

#### Docker

Simply build a Docker image with the provided Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t fmannhardt/course-processmining-intro .
```

And start the Docker container running Jupyter on port 8787:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 fmannhardt/course-processmining-intro
```

#### Jupyter

You should be able to run the Jupyter notebooks directly in a Jupyter environment. Please make sure to have installed the following requirements:

**Python**

```
pip install pandas pm4py plotline
```

Make sure to install GraphViz for the visualization. On Windows with Chocolately this should work:
```
 choco install graphviz
```
Consult the PM4Py documentation for further details:
https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/install

**R**

```
install.packages(c("IRkernel", "tidyverse", "bupaR", "processanimateR", "petrinetR", "R.utils"))
```

Depending on your system configuration, it can be tricky to make the `IRkernel` known to Jupyter. Please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel
As a hint, you may need to open the R console from an Anaconda console and perform `IRkernel::installspec()` in case you are using conda environment.
